### Description

This is my first attempt at writing a Pinball game in VB. It's just a demo. Please excuse the ugly graphics, I had to draw the main screen in 16 colors to make the file small enough to upload. You'll see the use of Sprites and a color Point collision detection method for ball movement. The "All Time High Score" is posted on the machine. I had fun making this, hope it will give someone a neat idea. You need DX7.
